** Disclaimer
  I am writing this code to get familiar with c.  My goal is
  to pimp this up a little, so that it might actually be possible to print
  sudokus in a nice way and waste some time solving them by hand.

** TODO Things that need to be done in my code: [1/4]
   - [X] Rewrite commit history.
     + I did this with the following command:
       git filter-branch --commit-filter 'export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="mail"; export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="First Last"; export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="First Last"; GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="email"; git commit-tree "$@"'
     + Check results with git log --pretty=fuller
   - [ ] Free the mallocs of reader.c
   - [ ] Add option to interactive mode, so that ps can be printed at the given state.
   - [ ] Implement golden chains
 
** Copyright
*** Thoughts
    The Apache2 license seems reasonable.  I really do not care what anyone
    does with my code, as long as I do not take any damage of it.  So
    take the code if you want, and have fun with.  (Or not, whatever...)
