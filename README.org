** Disclaimer
  I am writing this code to get a little familiar with c.  My goal is
  to pimp this up a little so that it actually possible to print
  sudokus in a nice way and waste some time solving sudokus by hand.

  I will also start sometime to mess around with the git repository.
  This will involve some sort of rebasing and so on, so if you merge
  this code with some of your own code, prepare for the merging of
  doom.

** TODO Things that need to be done in my code: [0/3]
     - [ ] Free the mallocs of reader.c
     - [ ] Add option to interactive mode, so that ps can be printed at the given state.
     - [ ] Implement golden chains
 
** Copyright
*** Thoughts
    The Apache2 license seems reasonable.  I really do not care what anyone
    does with my code, as long as I do not take any damage of it.  So
    take the code if you want, and have fun with.  (Or not, whatever...)
